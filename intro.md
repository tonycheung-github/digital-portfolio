```{tab-item} Things I learned
- I learned how to hide content from displaying in a .ipynb file. This could be useful for not showing long pieces of code that the reader may not be interested in reading.
- I learned about the system for how citations and references work. This will be useful when I am citing material and want a good way to organize them and display them.
- I learned about formatting and displaying various blocks of visual displays with blockquotes, dropdowns, and other directives. This will allow me to display certain content in more interesting ways.
```

```{tab-item} Things I found difficult
- What I found to be the most difficult was following the instructions for handling the within-page table of contents. I understood everything on the page in the Helpful Links provided, but if I understood everything correctly, the only thing that needs to be added is a simple contents directive. This still would have been fine, except for the fact that the instructions on the assignment said specifically to use the tableofcontents directive. This directive is already present in the intro.md file before I made any modifications to it, and it also is not a within-page table of contents. So, I was fairly confused about why it said to do that, when adding a within-page table of contents is just a simple addition of a contents directive. The fact that this was so simple makes me wonder if I missed something, and it is actually more complicated though.
- I did not have trouble with much else, but I would like some more explanations on certain instructions in the future. For example, we were told to delete certain files/folders (.ipynb_checkpoints, .jupyter,.virtual_documents) because otherwise we may encounter certain errors. It would be good to have a more thorough explanation of what is actually happening, like what those deleted files are for, and why they were there in the first place if the point was just to delete them.
